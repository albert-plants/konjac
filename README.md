# Konjac plant

## What is it

The konjac (Amorphophallus konjac) is a smaller relative of the giant corpse flower (Arum titanum). It makes a single leaf a year that lasts from May to roughly November. The underground corm doubles in size each year and will produce a bloom when it reaches softball size. It makes an interesting desk plant with the leopard patterned "stem".

## Contents

- small inner pot in wrapped in plastic
    - soiless potting medium (peat and perlite)
    - konjac corm (in the center under the soil)
- larger outer pot (to hold any runoff)

## Basic needs

- bright indoor light
- water about once a week

## One-time initial steps

1. unwrap the inner pot
1. place the inner pot inside the outer pot
1. soak the potting medium throughly
    1. may need to loosen the medium so that water can reach the inside
    1. may need to reposition the corm to the center of the pot if it falls out
    1. may need to pour any solids back into the inner pot

## FAQ

- How big does it get?
  - The small corm will grow to a couple inches tall. Once it uses up all the nutrients in the corm, the growth will stop and it will start storing up for a new corm.
- What's this liquid dripping from the leaf tips?
  - It's a process called guttation, which transports water through the plant to keep it rigid and upright. Excess water gets expelled at the leaf tips. This mainly happens at night.
- When to reduce watering?
  - Reduce watering when the leaf reaches full size. The potting mix is lightweight when dry and allows you to feel how much water is in it.
- When to stop watering?
  - When the leaf starts turning yellow, stop watering and let the soil dry out.
- What happens after?
  - Store the corm either in the dry soil or in a cool dry place for next season. It will start growing once the weather warms up.
  - Use a pot roughly 3x the width of the corm to allow room for roots and growth.
  - Large corms will produce more little ones.
